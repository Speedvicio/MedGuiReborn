    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Select sound driver.

The following choices are possible, sorted by preference, high to low, when "default" driver is used, 
but dependent on being compiled in.

default - Default
Default sound driver.

dsound - DirectSound
A recommended driver, and the default for Microsoft Windows.

sdl - Simple Directmedia Layer
This driver is not recommended, but it serves as a backup driver if the others aren't available.
 Its performance is generally sub-par, requiring higher latency or faster CPUs/SMP for glitch-free playback, 
except where the OS provides a sound callback API itself, such as with Mac OS X and BeOS.

wasapish - WASAPI(Shared Mode)
Shared-mode WASAPI driver, usable on Windows Vista and newer.

wasapi - WASAPI(Exclusive Mode)
Experimental exclusive-mode WASAPI driver, usable on Windows Vista and newer.
 Use it for lower-latency sound. May not work properly on all sound cards.</value>

    <value>Deinterlacer to use for interlaced video.

    weave - Good for low-motion video; can be used in conjunction with negative .scanlines setting values.

    bob - Good for causing a headache. All glory to Bob.

    bob_offset - Good for high-motion video, but is a bit flickery; reduces the subjective vertical resolution.

    blend - Blend fields together; reduces vertical and temporal resolution.

    blend_rg - Like the "blend" deinterlacer, but the blending is done in a manner that respects gamma, reducing unwanted brightness changes,
    at the cost of increased CPU usage.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ComboBox5.ToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Stretch to fill screen.

0 - Disabled

full - Full
Full-screen stretch, disregarding aspect ratio.

aspect - Aspect Preserve
Full-screen stretch as far as the aspect ratio(in this sense, the equivalent xscalefs == yscalefs) can be maintained.

aspect_int - Aspect Preserve + Integer Scale
Full-screen stretch, same as "aspect" except that the equivalent xscalefs and yscalefs are rounded down to the nearest integer.

aspect_mult2 - Aspect Preserve + Integer Multiple-of-2 Scale
Full-screen stretch, same as "aspect_int", but rounds down to the nearest multiple of 2.</value>

  <data name="ComboBox3.ToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Video output method/driver.

opengl - OpenGL + SDL
This output method is preferred, as all features are available with it.

sdl - SDL Surface
Slower with lower-quality scaling than OpenGL, but if you don't have hardware-accelerated OpenGL rendering, it will be faster than software OpenGL rendering. 
Bilinear interpolation not available. Pixel shaders do not work with this output method, of course.

overlay - SDL Overlay
As fast as OpenGL, perhaps faster in some situations, *if* it's hardware-accelerated. 
Scanline effects are not available. hq2x, hq3x, hq4x are not available. 
The OSD may be missing or glitchy. Bilinear interpolation can't be turned off. Harsh chroma subsampling blurring in some picture types.
If you use this output method, it is strongly recommended to use a special scaler with it, such as nn2x.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CheckBox2.ToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enable time synchronization(waiting) for frame blitting.

Disable to reduce latency, at the cost of potentially increased video "juddering", 
with the maximum reduction in latency being about 1 video frame's time.
 Will work best with emulated systems that are not very computationally expensive to emulate, 
combined with running on a relatively fast CPU</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TrackBar8.ToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enable scanlines with specified opacity.
Opacity is specified in %; IE a value of "100" will give entirely black scanlines.

Negative values are the same as positive values for non-interlaced video,
but for interlaced video will cause the scanlines to be overlaid over the previous field's lines
(only if the video.deinterlacer setting is set to "weave", the default).</value>

    <value>Enable specified special video scaler.

The destination rectangle is NOT altered by this setting, so if you have xscale and yscale set to "2", 
and try to use a 3x scaling filter like hq3x, the image is not going to look that great. 
The nearest-neighbor scalers are intended for use with bilinear interpolation enabled, at high resolutions
(such as 1280x1024; nn2x(or nny2x) + bilinear interpolation + fullscreen stretching at this resolution looks quite nice).

none - None/Disabled

hq2x - hq2x

hq3x - hq3x

hq4x - hq4x

scale2x - scale2x

scale3x - scale3x

scale4x - scale4x

2xsai - 2xSaI

super2xsai - Super 2xSaI

supereagle - Super Eagle

nn2x - Nearest-neighbor 2x

nn3x - Nearest-neighbor 3x

nn4x - Nearest-neighbor 4x

nny2x - Nearest-neighbor 2x, y axis only

nny3x - Nearest-neighbor 3x, y axis only

nny4x - Nearest-neighbor 4x, y axis only</value>

Obviously, this will only work with the OpenGL "video.driver" setting, and only on cards and OpenGL implementations that support shaders, 
otherwise you will get a black screen, or Mednafen may display an error message when starting up. 
When a shader is enabled, the ".videoip" setting is ignored.

none - None/Disabled

autoip - Auto Interpolation
Will automatically interpolate on each axis if the corresponding effective scaling factor is not an integer.

autoipsharper - Sharper Auto Interpolation
Same as "autoip", but when interpolation is done, it is done in a manner that will reduce blurriness if possible.

scale2x - Scale2x

sabr - SABR v3.0
GPU-intensive.

ipsharper - Sharper bilinear interpolation.

ipxnoty - Linear interpolation on X axis only.

ipynotx - Linear interpolation on Y axis only.

ipxnotysharper - Sharper version of "ipxnoty".

ipynotxsharper - Sharper version of "ipynotx".

goat - Simple approximation of a color TV CRT look.
Intended for fullscreen modes with a vertical resolution of around 1000 to 1500 pixels.

    <value>CPU emulation mode.

fast - Fast Mode
Fast mode trades timing accuracy, cache emulation, 
and executing from hardware registers and RAM not intended for code use for performance.

accurate - Accurate Mode
Increased timing accuracy, though not perfect, along with cache emulation, at the cost of decreased performance. 
Additionally, even the pipeline isn't correctly and fully emulated in this mode.

auto - Auto Mode
Selects "fast" or "accurate" automatically based on an internal database. 
If the CD image is not recognized, defaults to "fast".</value>

    <value>SPU output resampler quality.

0 is lowest quality and CPU usage, 10 is highest quality and CPU usage. 
The resampler that this setting refers to is used for converting from 44.1KHz to the sampling rate of the host audio device Mednafen is using. 
Changing Mednafen's output rate, via the "sound.rate" setting, to "44100" will bypass the resampler, 
which will decrease CPU usage by Mednafen, and can increase or decrease audio quality, 
depending on various operating system and hardware factors.</value>
